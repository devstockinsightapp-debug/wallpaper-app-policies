            <li>Use Google Play parental controls if needed</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>7. Duplicate Purchases</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>11. Regional Variations</h2>
        <p>
            Consumer protection laws vary by region. If your local laws provide additional refund rights beyond this policy, those rights remain in effect. This policy represents our baseline commitment but does not supersede stronger consumer protections in your jurisdiction.

        <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Refund Policy from time to time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

        <p>
            We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy when changes are made.
        </p>
