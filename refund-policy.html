We reserve the right to deny refunds if we detect abuse, including:

Excessive refund requests (requesting refunds for most purchases)

We do not offer partial refunds. Each wallpaper purchase is refunded in full or not at all.

11. Regional Variations
Consumer protection laws vary by region. If your local laws provide additional refund rights beyond this policy, those rights remain in effect. This policy represents our baseline commitment but does not supersede stronger consumer protections in your jurisdiction.
